# Endpoint Security Policy Deployment Plan

## Objective

This document outlines the strategy for deploying essential security configurations across all corporate Windows 10/11 endpoints. The goal is to ensure organizational compliance while reducing security risks through standardized policy enforcement.

## Target Environment

The deployment will cover all corporate-issued Windows devices including laptops, desktops, and workstations currently managed through Microsoft Intune and MECM infrastructure. This includes approximately 850 devices across our Edmonton office and remote locations throughout Alberta.

## Core Security Policies

The following policies have been identified as critical for our security baseline:

**BitLocker Encryption Policy**
Full-disk encryption will be mandatory for all corporate devices to protect data at rest. This addresses compliance requirements and protects against data breaches from lost or stolen equipment.

**Windows Defender Antivirus Configuration**
Real-time protection must remain active and cannot be disabled by end users. This ensures consistent malware protection across all endpoints.

**Windows Update Management**
Automatic updates will be enforced to maintain current security patches. Updates will be staged through our WSUS infrastructure to allow for testing before wide deployment.

**Local Administrator Rights Removal**
End users will have standard user privileges only. Administrative tasks will be handled through approved elevation tools or by IT staff.

**PowerShell Execution Policy**
Script execution will be restricted to signed scripts only, preventing unauthorized code execution while maintaining legitimate automation capabilities.

## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Preparation**
I'll start by creating the necessary security groups in Azure AD and corresponding device collections in MECM. The main group will be "Corporate Managed Devices" with sub-groups for different device types and locations.

**Phase 2: Policy Creation**
Each security policy will be configured as a separate configuration profile in Intune or as a baseline in MECM. For BitLocker, I'll use XTS-AES 256 encryption with TPM requirements. The Defender policy will enforce real-time scanning and prevent users from disabling protection.

**Phase 3: Pilot Testing**
Before full deployment, I'll test with a small group of volunteer users from IT and select business units. This pilot group of about 25 devices will help identify any compatibility issues or user experience problems.

**Phase 4: Communication**
Users will receive advance notification about the policy changes through email and our internal portal. I'll prepare documentation explaining any changes to their daily workflow, particularly around software installation restrictions.

**Phase 5: Staged Rollout**
Deployment will happen in waves over two weeks. First, administrative staff and power users, then general office workers, and finally remote users. This allows us to address issues before they affect the entire organization.

**Phase 6: Monitoring and Compliance**
I'll use the built-in reporting in Intune and MECM to track policy compliance. Additionally, I've created an automated inventory collection script that runs monthly to gather device specifications and health data. This information helps us proactively identify devices that may need attention or are due for refresh. Non-compliant devices will be flagged for follow-up, and users will receive notifications to update their systems.

## Rollback Strategy

If significant issues arise, I have prepared rollback procedures for each policy. BitLocker keys are escrowed to Azure AD for recovery. Other policies can be quickly disabled or modified through the management consoles. I've documented the baseline configurations to ensure we can return to the previous state if needed.

## Success Metrics

The deployment will be considered successful when we achieve 95% compliance across all policies within 30 days of full rollout. I'll track compliance rates, help desk tickets related to the changes, and user feedback to measure the impact.

## Tools and Technologies

This deployment leverages Microsoft Intune for cloud-managed devices and MECM for on-premises domain-joined systems. I've also developed a PowerShell inventory collection script that will run automatically on all endpoints to gather hardware information for our device refresh planning. This data feeds directly into our ServiceNow CMDB and helps identify devices that need upgrading. All changes will be documented in our ServiceNow knowledge base for future reference.

## Timeline

The entire project is expected to take 6 weeks from planning to full deployment, with ongoing monitoring continuing beyond that. The pilot phase will run for one week, followed by the two-week staged rollout, with the remaining time allocated for documentation and knowledge transfer.
