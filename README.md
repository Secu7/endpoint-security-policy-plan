# Endpoint Security Policy Deployment Project

## Background

I developed this project to demonstrate my practical understanding of endpoint management and security policy deployment. Having worked with various Windows environments, I wanted to create a comprehensive example that shows how I would approach a real-world policy deployment scenario using Microsoft Intune and MECM.

The project simulates the planning and automation work I would do as an Endpoint Analyst, focusing on the systematic approach to deploying security configurations across a corporate environment. While I don't currently have access to a full enterprise Intune or MECM environment, I've structured this project based on industry best practices and real-world deployment scenarios.

## What's Included

**Policy Deployment Plan**
This is a detailed written plan that outlines how I would deploy essential security policies to Windows 10/11 endpoints. It covers everything from the initial planning phase through rollout and monitoring. I've tried to make it realistic by including considerations for user communication, phased deployment, and rollback procedures.

**PowerShell Automation Script**
I've included a practical PowerShell script for automated endpoint inventory collection. This script gathers essential hardware and system information from Windows devices, which is crucial for device tracking and refresh planning. Rather than focusing on security enforcement scripts, I chose to create something that provides immediate business value and demonstrates understanding of real-world endpoint management needs. The script outputs data in JSON format that can easily integrate with ServiceNow or be exported for analysis in Excel and PowerBI.

## My Approach

When I started this project, I wanted to show that I understand both the technical and procedural aspects of endpoint management. The policy deployment plan demonstrates my ability to think through a complex project from start to finish, considering not just the technical implementation but also user impact, communication needs, and risk mitigation.

The PowerShell script shows my automation skills and understanding of practical endpoint management needs. I focused on inventory collection because it's something that provides immediate value to any organization - you need to know what devices you have before you can effectively manage them. The script is designed to be production-ready with clean output formatting that integrates well with enterprise systems like ServiceNow.

## Future Enhancements

If I had access to a full lab environment, I would extend this project to include actual policy testing and deployment metrics. I'm also interested in exploring more advanced automation scenarios and integration with other security tools that are commonly used alongside Intune and MECM.

This project represents my current understanding of endpoint management practices and my approach to tackling complex IT projects. I believe it demonstrates the kind of systematic thinking and technical skills that would be valuable in an Endpoint Analyst role.
